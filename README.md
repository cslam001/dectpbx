Archive of my ethernet DECT base station project i developed in 2006.

_Base station_
- Motorola MCF5282 as main processor
- Xilinx Spartan 3 as DECT controller
- UGSE6-202A from Panasonic DECT phone as RF module

_Controller_
Small linux daemon is used as a controller to connect one or more base stations into network.
It implements upper layers of the DECT and SIP protocols.
